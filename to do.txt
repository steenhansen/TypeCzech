 Extended classes are used for inheritance:
    <ul>
          <li>When TypeCzech is turned off no JavaScript code is imported</li>
          <li>With TypeCzech turned on, the supporting test code is imported:
            <ul> 
              <li class='floating_li'>TypeCzech.js</li> 
              <li class='floating_li'>TypeCzech_First.js</li> 
              <li class='floating_li'>TypeCzech_Last</li>
              <li class='floating_li'>TypeCzech_Full.js</li>
              <br>  <br><br>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Production classes declarations <b>must</b>

Extending Classes Inline:
<ul>
<li>Everything is in one file, no code imports</li>
<li>Production class declarations <b>must</b> interleave with TypeCzech calls</li>
</ul>

Extending Classes Imports: 
<ul>
<li>Multiple code files, both TypeCzech and production code imported</li>
<li>With no checking, only production code from First.js, Last.js, and Full.js are imported</li>
<li>With TypeCzech turned on TypeCzech.js, TypeCzech_First.js, TypeCzech_Last, and   
TypeCzech_Full.js are all imported as well</li>
</ul>

Extending Classes Production:
<ul>
<li>No testing code imported when TypeCzech is turned off</li>
<li>When TypeCzech is turned on then TypeCzech.js, TypeCzech_First.js,
   TypeCzech_Last, and TypeCzech_Full.js are all imported
<li>When TypeCzech is turned on then TypeCzech.js, TypeCzech_First.js,
Smallest footprint, fastest load, but can still turn on checking</li>
</ul>

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Intercepting extended class construction and method 
calls is TypeCzech's most difficult case.
Class declarations are done inside functions so as 
to enable the interleaving of PRE and POST functions 
in lockstep with class extensions.


one download
  Pros: simple one download without any later importing of JavaScript files
 
  Cons:  but entire TypeCzech is shipped to client browsers for interpretation
        class/closure initialization is done via functions



all download
  Pros: Class/Closure declarations are in their own one distinct files
        thus easy to manipulate
  
  Cons: Each class/closure definition, including production code, has to be downloaded 
        and interpreted after the main file



 production code inlined checks downloaded

  Pros: TypeCzech code is not downloaded if TypeCzech is turned off
         
  Cons: Class/Closure declarations have to be separated into 
        function calls to enable function/method interception by TypeCzech
