Intercepting extended class construction and method 
calls is TypeCzech's most difficult case.
Class declarations are done inside functions so as 
to enable the interleaving of PRE and POST functions 
in lockstep with class extensions.


one download
  Pros: simple one download without any later importing of JavaScript files
 
  Cons:  but entire TypeCzech is shipped to client browsers for interpretation
        class/closure initialization is done via functions



all download
  Pros: Class/Closure declarations are in their own one distinct files
        thus easy to manipulate
  
  Cons: Each class/closure definition, including production code, has to be downloaded 
        and interpreted after the main file



 production code inlined checks downloaded

  Pros: TypeCzech code is not downloaded if TypeCzech is turned off
         
  Cons: Class/Closure declarations have to be separated into 
        function calls to enable function/method interception by TypeCzech
