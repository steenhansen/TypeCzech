multiple pages????? that all get the first/last/full names???






idea new folder 700   works both in web and node.js

should have three different runs

 node --trace-uncaught list-of-names.js (mix of first last full names)


idea is to have three separate files all reading in the type stuff
copy 402 

hhmmm web has to have waits in it



maybe just do a node one, with 3 files to run, no promises
